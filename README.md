### Premise:

We chose to compete in the inclusion category in order to create a solution for the vissualy impaired to ease their life.

### Implementation:

Using GPT-4o API in conjunction with Whisper API and Google TTS we implemented a solution for 3 main issues that have a high impact on someone visually impared, those being:
-Navigating around a nonfamiliar room
-Reading product text
-Navigating the dangerous streets and environment of the city

### Technology stack:

Strictly bashed wrapped with python scripts in order for it to be easily implemented on our 3D designed prototype.

### Proof of concept prototype:
